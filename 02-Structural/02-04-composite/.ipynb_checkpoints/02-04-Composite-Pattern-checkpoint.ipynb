    "## Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern which defines part-whole relationship between objects within a tree structure.\n",
    "In a complex tree structure, it's a challenge to discriminate between a leaf and branch. We need to have type check before performing any operation on the tree structure and complexity grows if we have varied types of leaf and branches. This leads to higher maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMAGE: Tree with composite and leaf elements\n",
    "\n",
    "A composite design pattern helps simplify above mentioned issue by introducing a common interface which needs to be implemented by leaf and branches thereby generalizing the solution to a problem.\n"

    "\n",
    "IMAGE: 3 components\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Component:** This is the abstraction/interface for all the elements in a tree. It includes both leaf and branches. The operations performed on all the elements is defined here and this is how it eliminates the need for a type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Leaf:** It represents the leaf element in a tree and doesn't contain any child elements. It also implements all the operations defined in a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Composite:** It is composed of multiple elements as child. It does implement all the operations defined in a component and mostly delegate the exectution to chile elemenets.\n"
